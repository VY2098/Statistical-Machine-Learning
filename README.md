# Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework for Machine Learning. It consists of two main projects: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification and K-means clustering for handwritten digits classification.

### 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
In this project, I implemented an SVM to perform binary classification. The implementation involves the training of an SVM model on a dataset using a linear kernel and regularization.

#### Key Features:
- Implemented SVM training in primal form with regularization parameter `C`.
- Defined objective function and constraints using convex optimization.
- Utilized `cvxpy` for solving the optimization problem.
- Calculated accuracy of the model on test data.
- Identified and analyzed support vectors from the training set.

#### Results:
- SVM Model Parameters: Weights and Bias.
- Test Accuracy: (Include your test accuracy here.)
- Number of Support Vectors: (Include the count here.)

### 2. Digits Clusters - Handwritten Digit Classification
This project explores unsupervised machine learning using the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize handwritten digits. The goal is to group images of digits based on similarities without using labeled data.

#### Description:
- Developed a K-means clustering model to classify handwritten digits.
- Preprocessed image data to prepare for unsupervised learning.
- Applied dimensionality reduction techniques for better performance.
- Analyzed and visualized the results to validate the effectiveness of the model.

#### Achievements:
- Unsupervised learning model to classify digits into distinct clusters.
- Effective grouping of similar digits using K-means.
- Optimization of model parameters for cluster accuracy and efficiency.

#### Technologies Used:
- K-means clustering algorithm.
- Data preprocessing for image data.
- PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Visualization tools for interpreting results.
